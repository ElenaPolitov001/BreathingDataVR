# BreathingDataVR
This repository contains description about the BreathingDataVR dataset and link where the dataset could be downloaded. The BreathingDataVR dataset was created by [Emteq Labs](https://www.emteqlabs.com/). This dataset was originally used in our study ["Breathing Rate Estimation from Head-Worn Photoplethysmography Sensor Data Using Machine Learning"](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/6/2079).

# Description
- For data collection, we used the [emteqPRO system](https://www.emteqlabs.com/emteqpro/), consisting of a VR sensor mask insert with a Pico Neo 2 Eye VR headset.
- The dataset is comprised of three .csv files, which correspond to the three datasets used in our study.
- Each file contains raw PPG, accelerometer data and labelled breathing rate.
- The total duration of the collected data is 178 minutes.
